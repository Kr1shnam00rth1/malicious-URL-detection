### What I accomplished 

+ I performed feature engineering to extract key URL-related features, resulting in a dataset with fully developed attributes.
+ I developed an ensemble model using logistic regression, KNN, decision tree, Naive Bayes, and SVM.
+ Performed training and testing and ended with tesing accuracy of 95.5%.
