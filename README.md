### What I accomplished 

+ I conducted feature engineering to extract essential URL-related attributes, creating a comprehensive dataset.
+ I then built an ensemble model utilizing logistic regression, KNN, decision tree, Naive Bayes, and MLP (Neural Network).
+ After training and testing, I achieved a testing accuracy of 96%.
